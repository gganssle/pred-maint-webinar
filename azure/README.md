# Azure Workflow

Since data from oil and gas producers is expensive to acquire and proprietary, it's hard to find open source data in the predictive-maintenance-for-oil-production-equipment domain. The ML team at Azure has put together a wonderful piece of open source work to complete this experiment. This folder contains a derivative of that work for comparison with our algorithm.

The original notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/lstms_for_predictive_maintenance/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Basics%20for%20Predictive%20Maintenance.ipynb).

The data can be downloaded using
```
wget http://azuremlsamples.azureml.net/templatedata/PM_train.txt
wget http://azuremlsamples.azureml.net/templatedata/PM_test.txt
wget http://azuremlsamples.azureml.net/templatedata/PM_truth.txt
